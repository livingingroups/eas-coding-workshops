# EAS Coding Workshops

This repo houses materials for coding workshops run by @katrinabrock
in the Ecology of Animal Societies Department at the Max Plank Institute of Animal Behavior.

Target audience is scientists with beginning to intermediate knowledge of either R or python looking to upskill.

Sessions vary in style from lecture style with full content listed here to fully interactive with only some basics here.

## [Writing Code that Other People Can Read](./20240319-readability)

**Description:** 
Do you ever feel like only computers know what your code is doing? We'll explore ways to write code that even humans can understand (e.g. yourself, your future self, your code reviewer).

This session was run 29 October 2024 and 19 March 2024. With only minor changes between the two sessions.

This session has examples in both R and python. Exercises can be done in either language. Most of the content is written in the README. Exercises are provided.

A revised and abbreviated version of the content (python only, no exercises) can be found in the "Readability" section of the [Code Review](./20241212-codereview) workshop presented BioAccustic AI workshop.

## [Validating Code as Author and Reviewer](./20241105-validating)

**Description:** Does your code do what you think it does? Are you sure? What about the code you're reviewing? In this session, we'll put our code to test, learn new ways to automatically check our code, and/or uncover hidden bugs.

This session was run workshop-style in R twice 05 November 2024 with tinytest and 26 March 2024 with testthat ([Material Here](https://github.com/livingingroups/eas-coding-workshops/tree/b2052696d4dd7d5f71c815c81f54a66f83d86051/20240326-validating)). Similar content lecture-style in python was covered in the "Reliability" section of the [Code Review](./20241212-codereview) workshop presented BioAccustic AI workshop.

All three of these sessions were primarily demos and exercises so the content is mostly code, and not much text. Likely not useful to those who didn't attend the session.

## [R Project Structure: One source(...) to Rule Them All](./20241112-project-structure)

**Description:** Is your project experiencing growing pains? From a single-use script through a multi script workflow all the way to a package, we’ll cover options for organizing your code. You’ll learn tips and best practices with a focus on clarity, reusability, and ease to modify and debug.

This session was run in R on 12 November 2024. Content is a mix of lecture style and demo so all the content is in the readme + demos.

## [Making Your Code Run Faster](./20240402-performance)

**Description:** What's taking so long and how can I make it not taske so long? The answer may surprise you.

This session was run lecture-style with some demos 02 April 2024. All materials are in both R and python. All the content is covered in the README.


## Using Github for Feedback and Collaboration

**Description:** Does your repo feel lonely? We will explore how to get the most out of Github for soliciting feedback on your code, as well as coding collaboratively with others.

This session was 100% interactive so materials are likely not so useful for those who didn't attend. 
Each session worked from its own toy repo (not from this one) so participants could have a sandbox.

- [19 November 2024 Version](https://github.com/livingingroups/telephone2024fall) R only
- [16 April 2024 Version](https://github.com/livingingroups/telephone2024) Supports R and python (with reticulate).

##  Intro to Python for R Users
**Description:** Ready to branch into a new language? Let python’s simplicity, flexibility, and vast ecosystem win you over.

The session was run 26 November 2024. We went through parts of Cornell Center for Advanced Computing's [Intro to python](https://cvw.cac.cornell.edu/python-intro/data-operations/index) and supplemented with some comparisons of R to python.

## [Live Code Review](./20240429-review)

**Description:** We will take some code from one or two brave victims and apply what we've learned about writing readable, effective, and efficient code.

This session was run 30 April 2024. We commented on some code. This code an comments are provided.

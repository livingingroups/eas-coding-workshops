# Agenda

For each of the following topics, we'll spend some time reading and running the code independently, then come back together and discuss.

- Readability
  - What makes this code easy or hard to understand?
  - How could this code be more readable?
- Effectiveness:
   - How would you go about testing that this code does what it's supposed to?
   - How could your reorganize the code to make that testing more straight forward?
- Efficiency:
   - What resource is the bottleneck in this code? (CPU? Memory? Something else?)
   - Which parts of the code should we focus on to improve efficiency of that resource?
   - What strategies could we use to make those parts run faster?
   
The script getting the code review was `08_comoving_analysis_AA\ rewrite2.R`, `subset.R` was used to generate a subset of the data suitable for testing, all other scripts are possible rewrites and tests for different portions generated during the workshop.

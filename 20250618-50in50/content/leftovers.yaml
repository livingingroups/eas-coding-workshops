    who: I have two pretty complicated objects (e.g. lists).
    problems: [I want to see if they're the same or not]
  concept of mocking:
    who: Theres really only one (or a few) steps that take a really long time in my code (such as running a model). I like to get everything surrounding the model working, and then run everything together.
    problems:
      - A lot of times, I run the model and then kill it multiple times just to make sure I've got my inputs in the right format.
      - I find it difficult to write the code after the long part without runnning the long part.

Performance:
  Profiling:
    python: yes
    r: yes
    who: My code runs slower than I want it to.
    problems:
      - I don't know what part of my code is the slow part
  Benchmarking:
    python: yes
    r: yes
    who: I know what part of my code is slow, and I want to make it faster.
    problems:
      - I'm not sure what is the most effective way to make it faster.
  atime:
    python: no
    r: yes
    who: I have already benchmarked my code with a little bit of data.
    problems:
      - I'm afraid the time will increase non-linearly when I add more data.
  BLAS replacement:
    python: yes
    r: yes
    who: I've already optimized my code so it uses a lot of vector/matrix/numpy operations instead of for loops.
    problems:
      - I want shave some time off of those big vector/matrix operations.
  fst:
    python: no
    r: yes
    who: I load really big CSVs.
    problems:
      - I want to load my big CSVs really fast.
  futures:
    python: no
    r: yes
    who: I have several pieces of long running code that I would like to run independently.
    problems:
      - I want to parallelize my code using state of the art framework.
      - I want my code to be able to run in parallel or not in parallel without making big changes.
      - I want to be able to run part of my code without it "blocking" my R session.
      - In the future, I want to use High Performance Computers without changing my code.

# Intro

44 Tips in 44 Mins

## Goals

🤔 Everyone learns something interesting.

🤔 Every tip is interesting to someone.

🛠️ Every coder learns something useful.

⚖️ Cover topics roughly in proportion to how many people they are relevant to.

## Goals

If the tip is relevant to you, you can

- identify that it's relevant.
- tell in what situation you would use it.
- know how to get started.

## Anti goals

- Proscriptivism
- Any one person finding every tip interesting
- Any one tip being interesting to everyone
- Give enough context that everyone can understand every tip
- Giving every detail needed to implement the tip

::: {.fragment}
- I don't want to completely re-write it, but I want to make it easier to run and debug.
:::

::: {.fragment}
- Rerunning my entire script takes a long time, but when I rerun line by line I lose reproduciblity because I'm running things out of order.
:::

::: {.fragment}
- I want to make sure I'm not breaking something that was already working when I write something.

### . . . and  . . .


::: {.fragment}
- It gets tricky to remember which parts of my pipeline are "fresh" and what needs to be re-run.
:::

::: {.fragment}
- Some parts of my pipeline could in theory be run in parallel with one another (e.g. processing two different types of data that are ulimately put together), but it's a pain start more than one script at once.

::: footer
Tip #5: Data Validation vs Software Testing



:::


---

### . . . and  . . .


::: {.fragment}
- Sometimes I get my code running with one set of data, including various checks throughout, but when I introduce a new dataset, the checks aren't always appropriate.
:::

::: {.fragment}
- It's sometimes hard to tell if I made a coding error if the data is just messier than I thought.
:::




::: footer
Tip #5: Data Validation vs Software Testing



:::


---

* *Software Testing*
  - Is my code correct?
  - Does my code do the transformations I'm expecting it to do?
  - How? Running code with known input, verify expected output.
* *Data Validation*
  - Does the data I'm feeding into my code match the assumptions I'm making about it?
  - How? Check inputs before transforming.

:::


---

### My recommendation

Start with vanilla dataframe/base R.

Switch to data.table when you:

* think you need to loop over the rows of your dataframe
* have to write multiple lines for a single operation to avoid looping (Example: Mean of one variable grouped by another variable.)
* want things to run faster

----

### Why?

  * Learning more base R will be an advantage in your R coding life regardless of what other packages you use
  * dplyr may be more intuitive than data.table at first, but much less scalable. If you're at the point where you need to move beyond base R, you're not too far from the point where you need something more efficient than dplyr.
  * data.table requires a bit more upfront learning due to its concise syntax. However, after that small initial investment, it becomes both faster to write and faster to run.

These philosophical movements respect one another, simply have different goals.

* **tidyverse** prioritizes user-friendliness, explicitly deprioritizes compute efficiency, implicitly deprioritizes longevity 
* **fastverse** prioritizes compute efficiency, some attention paid to longevity (stable interface), implicitly deprioritizing user-friendliness 
* **tinyverse** prioritizes longevitiy by minimizing dependencies
When chosing what packages to add to your project for core data manipulation, understand what you may be trading off in terms of efficiency and longevity.

---

### . . . and  . . .


::: {.fragment}
- If I store my somewhat processed data in CSVs, I have to write a bunch of code at the beginning to make sure everything is the right datatype.
:::

::: {.fragment}
- If I use pickle/rdata, I'm locked into using a particular datastructure (e.g. dataframe v.s. data table v.s. tibble)
:::

::: {.fragment}
- If I use pickle/Rdata interoperating between R and python (or other languages) can be tricky.
:::

::: {.fragment}
- Sometimes I just need a few rows from a huge file so loading the entire file feels like a waste.
:::

::: {.fragment}
- I have multiple dataframes that should be linked together. (e.g. an "individuals" data frame and a "behaviors" data frame with individual_id as a column), and I end up having to copy the linking code from script to script.

* Relational databases allow you to store your data, column headers, datatype *AND* relationships between tables.
* Duckdb allows you do this with minimal setup.
  - Install as you would any other R or python package.
  - Data is stored in a single file simlar to pickle or .rds file.
* Relations between tables (or data frames) are stored explicitly.
* You can load only particular rows/columns into your session.

  SELECT * 
  FROM observations

### . . . and  . . .


::: {.fragment}
- I have similar problems to those listed under previous tip
:::

::: {.fragment}
- Since my data doesn't fit so well into data frame format, many standard data processing tools aren't super helpful.
:::

::: {.fragment}
- Even if I use graph-specific packages (like networkx), I end up writing a lot of custom code just to explore my data.

* Rocker project has stored shapshots as docker containers of R itself, rstudio, and common package suites (tidyverse, cuda, geospatial, etc.). You can run these in VSCode (tutorial linked in previous tip) or use rstudio from the container (ask me how).
* Docker Community maintains official python images, these have minimal libraries.
* Check if the project or package you're primarily using published its own image in the timeframe you're interested in.

Where to find author's preferred citation method:

  * In R `citation('package_name')` e.g. `citation('ctmm')`
  * For non-R packages, there is often a `CITATION` file right next to the README that tells how the authors wish to be cited.
  * Some non-R packages, such as pandas have citation info [explicitly on their site](https://pandas.pydata.org/about/citing.html).

* Spending a bit of time to make your issue as clear as possible and reproducible is a bigger contribution.
* Even the feedback of "this was hard to figure out from the docs" is valuable, especially if accompanied by a concrete suggestion.

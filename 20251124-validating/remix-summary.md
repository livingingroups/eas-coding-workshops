This workshop is based on the Carpentries Incubator building better research software.
However, it has been substantially changed. All the code and tooling has been translated to R.
Some sections have been removed. It has also been edited to work as a standalone workshop.

The part of the setup explaining the sample code and data is also pulled in and remixed.
